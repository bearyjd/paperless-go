Name: Paperless Go
Summary: A modern mobile client for Paperless-ngx

Description: |
  Paperless Go is a mobile client for Paperless-ngx, the popular self-hosted
  document management system.

  Manage your documents on the go with a clean, modern interface:
  * Browse, search, and filter your document library
  * View document details, thumbnails, and PDF previews
  * Upload new documents via camera scan or file picker
  * Receive shared files from other apps for quick upload
  * Manage tags, correspondents, document types, and storage paths
  * Edit document metadata and custom fields
  * Bulk operations: tag, re-tag, delete, and more
  * Biometric authentication for secure access
  * Offline-capable with local caching
  * Full-text search with autocomplete

  Paperless Go connects to your self-hosted Paperless-ngx server using
  token-based authentication. You need a running Paperless-ngx instance
  to use this app.
